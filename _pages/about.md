Hi. Welcome to my personal website!

Biography
======
I'm currently (about to be) a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Robotics at University of Michigan. I graduated from UM-SJTU Joint Institute where I received a BS degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiaotong University and a BS degree in Computer Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2020. 
I continue to pursue my PhD degree in Robotics at Umich, advised by [Prof. Ram Vasudevan](http://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal). I passed my qualification exam and advanced to candidacy in 2022.
Here is a link to my [Resume](https://github.com/Cfather/jimzhang.github.io/blob/master/images/Bohao_Zhang_Resume.pdf).

Research Interest
======
My research focuses on the safe locomotion of bipedal robots. Bipedal robots are appealing since they are very similar to human beings. And as a result, they should be capable of doing the similar things that human beings can do.
However, deploying biepdal robots widely still remains a great challenge due to the natural unstablity of bipedal walking. I would like to research on reliable and robust algorithms on bipedal locomotion and manipulation.
